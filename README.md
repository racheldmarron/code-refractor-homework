# HTML, CSS and Git: Code Refractor Homework 

## Summary of My Task & User Story 
<ul>
<li>This assigment had a user story of updating alt text of a marketing agency's website in order to optimize the website for SEO.</li>
<li>Additionally, this assignment wanted to update the code to include semantic HTML elements and ensure all CSS was in logical structure and sequential order.</li>
<li>Lastly, all links in the Navigation were meant to lead down to applicable information.</li>
</ul>

## Updates I Made
<ul>
<li> Removed all div and created semantic HTML elements including: header, nav, footer, main, article, figure, aside, and section</li>
<li>Then, I went in to the CSS to ensure all .classes were removed and updated with the semantic HTML element used. For example, I removed the .header and updated CSS to read header</li>
<li>In doing so, I was able to remove reduntant CSS snd format so all elements had the same styling necessary.</li>
<li>I re-organized CSS to ensure that all elements were reading sequentially as they appeared in the HTML.</li>
<li>I added comments into CSS to label out "Universal" and "Element" selectors</li>
<li>Alt text was added to all 6 jps and pngs on the site to follow Accessibility guidelines and increase SEO. </li>
<li>I created a unique title in order to increase SEO and have the website description unique and applicable to the marketing agency's website.</li>
  </ul>

## Publishing to GitHub
<ul>
  <li>I created a new repository on my GitHub account titled "code-refractor-homework"</li>
  <li>I pulled the repository onto my computer and committed changes to GitHub as necessary</li>
</ul>
