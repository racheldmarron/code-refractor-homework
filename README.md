# HTML, CSS and Git: Code Refractor Homework 

## Summary of My Task & User Story 

This assigment had a user story of updating alt text of a marketing agency's website in order to optimize the website for SEO. 
Additionally, this assignment wanted to update the code to include semantic HTML elements and ensure all CSS was in logical structure and sequential order. 
Lastly, all links in the Navigation were meant to lead down to applicable information.

## Updates I Made

Removed all <div> and created semantic HTML elements including: <header>, <nav>, <footer>, <main>, <article>, <figure>, <aside>, and <section> 
Then, I went in to the CSS to ensure all .classes were removed and updated with the semantic HTML element used. For example, I removed the .header and updated CSS to read header
In doing so, I was able to remove reduntant CSS snd format so all elements had the same styling necessary. 
I re-organized CSS to ensure that all elements were reading sequentially as they appeared in the HTML. 
I added comments into CSS to label out "Universal" and "Element" selectors 
Alt text was added to all 6 jps and pngs on the site to follow Accessibility guidelines and increase SEO. 
I created a unique <title> in order to increase SEO and have the website description unique and applicable to the marketing agency's website. 

## Publishing to GitHub

I created a new repository on my GitHub account titled "code-refractor-homework"
I pulled the repository onto my computer and committed changes to GitHub as necessary
